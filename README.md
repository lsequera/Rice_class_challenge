## Rice Classification Challenge

This repository contains a proposal to solve the challenge found in the repository [Challenge](https://github.com/NetworkAI-UniAndes/classification-exam-fisi-3650.git), where the data can also be found.

## Context 
------
As suggested in the challenge repository, neural networks have been used to solve the challenge. The code requires TensorFlow/Keras to build the models. The two proposed models are based on the architectures of LeNet and AlexNet respectively, the second having better performance.

The pre-trained model can be downloaded from this google drive link [AlexNet](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Dyb62Z_-XYtEHaiZ3Ytjs_wcjaIh5apC/view?usp=sharing)

## Deliverables
------
It is included the scripts **model.py** and **eval.py** with the respective modifications to import and evaluate the model. It also includes the python notebook **RiceClassChalenge.ipynb** and the script **riceclasschalenge.py** with the source code to compile and fit the models.

### Extra
------
The script **test.py** is a little Desktop GUI based on PyQt, it allows testing and evaluating the model by dragging and dropping a rice image in the interface.
